## About
Research is a simple simple chatbot that can do some basic interactions like reading from a file or fetching content from a link.

This exists because I just wanted a simple way to talk to an llm locally.

Research supports any model on ollama

## Usage
* You can attach a file using `@file(filename)`
* You can attach a link using `@link(link)`
